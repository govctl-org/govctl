## Context

govctl manages three governance artifact types — RFCs, ADRs, and work items. We need to add AI-assisted capabilities for both *creating* (writing) and *reviewing* these artifacts.

Per [[ADR-0023]], the `assets/` directory is organized into `commands/`, `skills/`, and `agents/` subdirectories. Skills and agents are synced to `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` respectively.

### Problem Statement

Each artifact type needs writing guidance (structure, conventions, quality patterns) and review criteria (completeness checks, quality gates). The question: should each capability be a **skill** (augments the main agent inline) or an **agent** (runs as isolated subagent with its own system prompt)?

### Key Distinction

- **Skills** run in the main agent's context. They have full access to the conversation and codebase. They augment what the main agent knows.
- **Agents** run in isolated contexts with custom system prompts. They receive delegated tasks and return results. They have no access to the main conversation.

### Constraints

- Skills MUST be <250 lines per SKILL.md (progressive disclosure via `references/`)
- Agents MUST have focused system prompts
- Each capability should follow "one skill, one capability" principle
- The existing `/discuss` and `/gov` commands orchestrate workflows that need writing knowledge"""
decision = """
## Decision

**Writers are skills. Reviewers are agents.** Six separate items total:

### Skills (in `assets/skills/`)

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rfc-writer` | How to write well-structured RFCs: normative language (MUST/SHOULD/MAY), clause structure, versioning, `since` fields |
| `adr-writer` | How to write effective ADRs: context/decision/consequences, trade-off analysis, alternatives documentation |
| `wi-writer` | How to write good work items: acceptance criteria with category prefixes, description quality |

### Agents (in `assets/agents/`)

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `rfc-reviewer` | Review RFC drafts for completeness, normative language quality, clause coverage, cross-references |
| `adr-reviewer` | Review ADR drafts for context quality, decision clarity, alternatives, honest consequences |
| `wi-reviewer` | Review work items for acceptance criteria structure, category correctness, description quality |

### Rationale

1. **Writers need conversation context.** An RFC writer must know *why* the user is creating the RFC — what problem, what constraints, what existing artifacts relate. Skills run inline and have full context.

2. **Reviewers benefit from cognitive isolation.** When the main agent writes an artifact and then reviews it, confirmation bias is unavoidable. An isolated review agent has no memory of authoring — it evaluates purely on quality criteria.

3. **Six separate, not consolidated.** RFC/ADR/WI writing are genuinely different capabilities. Each skill stays well under 250 lines. The ~15% shared knowledge (govctl commands, `[[ref]]` syntax) is 3-5 lines of duplication — not worth coupling distinct capabilities to eliminate.

### Integration

- `/discuss` and `/gov` commands will reference writer skills for quality guidance
- Review agents can be invoked at quality gates (e.g., after drafting, before finalization)
- `sync-assets.sh` already syncs both `skills/` and `agents/` directories"""
consequences = """
## Consequences

### Positive
- Writers augment the main agent with domain knowledge while preserving conversation context
- Reviewers provide unbiased quality checks through cognitive isolation
- Six focused items follow "one skill, one capability" — each stays under 250 lines
- Future artifact types get their own skill + agent pair without touching existing files
- `sync-assets.sh` already supports the directory structure ([[ADR-0023]])

### Negative
- 6 files to maintain (mitigation: each is small and focused, changes are rare)
- ~15% knowledge duplication across items (mitigation: 3-5 lines per file, not worth abstracting)
- Review agents lack conversation context (mitigation: they receive artifact paths and evaluate on merit, which is the point)

### Neutral
- Existing `/discuss` and `/gov` commands continue to work unchanged initially; skills/agents integration is additive"""
