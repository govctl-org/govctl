context = """
ADRs and Work Items need a human-readable, machine-parseable format.
JSON is verbose and hard to edit manually. YAML has implicit typing issues.
TOML provides explicit typing, clean multiline strings, and good tooling support."""
decision = """
Use TOML for ADRs and Work Items instead of JSON.
Structure follows [govctl] metadata section and [content] body section.
This aligns with Rust ecosystem conventions (Cargo.toml)."""
consequences = """
Positive: Easier manual editing, cleaner diffs, natural multiline support.
Negative: Different format from RFC clauses (which remain JSON for richer structure).
Migration: Existing JSON-based work items would need conversion."""
