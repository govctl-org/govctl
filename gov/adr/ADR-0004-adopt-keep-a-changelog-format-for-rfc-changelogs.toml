context = "RFC changelogs use a flat changes array. This makes it difficult to categorize changes by type (additions, fixes, removals). The Keep a Changelog format (keepachangelog.com) is a widely-adopted standard that organizes changes into semantic categories aligned with semver."
decision = "Replace the flat changes array with categorized arrays: added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed, security. Keep summary field as optional notes. Migrate existing RFC-0000 changelog (trivial: one entry)."
consequences = "Positive: Standard format, better scanability, semver-aligned categories. Negative: More verbose schema, breaking change to ChangelogEntry model. Migration cost is minimal (RFC-0000 has only one entry)."
