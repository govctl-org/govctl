Rename commands_dir to agent_dir for clarity.

BREAKING CHANGE: config.toml must use agent_dir instead of commands_dir.
Old value .claude/commands should be changed to .claude.

The new design is cleaner:
- agent_dir points directly to the IDE root (e.g., .claude, .cursor)
- Commands, skills, agents subdirs are created under it
- No need to call .parent() to get the actual directory"""
