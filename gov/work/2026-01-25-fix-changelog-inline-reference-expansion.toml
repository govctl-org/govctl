Fix `render changelog` to expand inline `[[artifact-id]]` references to proper markdown links.

Previously, patterns like `[[RFC-0002:C-RESOURCE-MODEL]]` were rendered literally instead of being converted to clickable links. Now they expand to `[RFC-0002:C-RESOURCE-MODEL](docs/rfc/RFC-0002.md#rfc-0002c-resource-model)`.

The base path is read from `config.paths.docs_output` instead of being hardcoded."""
