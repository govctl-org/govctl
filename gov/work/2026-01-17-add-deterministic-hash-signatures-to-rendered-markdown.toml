description = """
Implement deterministic hash signatures for rendered markdown files to ensure they are read-only projections of the authoritative SSOT (JSON/TOML).

Key requirements:
- Hash is SHA-256 of canonical content (not file bytes)
- Files and fields must be sorted recursively for determinism
- Signature embedded as HTML comment in rendered markdown
- govctl check verifies signatures match source content
- Any direct edit to markdown breaks the signature

This enforces: "edit the source, not the projection""""
