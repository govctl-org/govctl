Add shell autocompletion support for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell using `clap_complete`.

Implement a `govctl completions <shell>` command that generates completion scripts. Users can then install them to get tab-completion for commands, flags, and options.

Phase 1: Static completion (commands, flags, options)
Future: Dynamic completion (artifact IDs, field names)"""
