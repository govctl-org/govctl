description = """
Improve the `delete` command to auto-detect artifact type from ID format, making type flags optional.

Currently: `govctl delete clause RFC-0001:C-NAME` or `govctl delete work WI-2026-01-19-001`

Proposed: `govctl delete RFC-0001:C-NAME` with optional `--clause`, `--work` flags for explicitness.

This makes `delete` consistent with `edit` (which already auto-detects) and reduces typing. The ID formats are unambiguous, so auto-detection is safe."""
