description = """
The `govctl mv` command help text says `<FILE>` but the code actually supports both file paths and WI-IDs.

Current help:
```
govctl move <FILE> <STATUS>
```

The gov.md documentation says:
```
govctl mv <WI-ID> <status>
```

The code supports both - it first tries WI-ID lookup, then file path matching. The help text should reflect this."""
