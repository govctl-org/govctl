Fix design flaws in artifact lifecycle state machines identified through analysis:

1. Clause: Remove 'deprecated' from 'kind' enum (duplicates 'status')
2. ADR: Add 'rejected' state to lifecycle
3. Work Item: Allow direct queue→cancelled transition
4. RFC: Document status×phase constraint rules clearly

These changes ensure cleaner separation of concerns and complete lifecycle coverage."""
