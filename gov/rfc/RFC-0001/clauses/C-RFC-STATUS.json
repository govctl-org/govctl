  "text": "An RFC MUST have exactly one of the following status values:\n\n1. **draft** — Initial state. The RFC is under development and not yet binding.\n2. **normative** — The RFC defines required behavior. Implementations MUST conform. Normative RFCs MAY be amended via version bumping; amendments MUST include a changelog entry documenting the change.\n3. **deprecated** — The RFC is no longer recommended. Existing conforming implementations MAY continue, but new implementations SHOULD NOT use this RFC.\n\nValid transitions:\n- draft → normative (via `finalize` command)\n- normative → deprecated (via `deprecate` command)\n\nInvalid transitions (MUST be rejected):\n- normative → draft (no \"un-finalize\")\n- deprecated → normative (no resurrection)\n- deprecated → draft (no resurrection)\n- Any skip (e.g., draft → deprecated directly)",
