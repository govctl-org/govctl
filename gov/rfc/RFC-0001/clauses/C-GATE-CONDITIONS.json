All acceptance criteria MUST have status \"done\" or \"cancelled\" (no \"pending\")\n\nRationale: Prevents marking work as complete without defined success criteria.\n\n**RFC draft → normative:**\n- No additional gates (policy decision, not structural)\n\n**RFC phase spec → impl:**\n- RFC status SHOULD be normative (warning if draft)\n\nRationale: Implementation should follow finalized specification.\n\n**RFC phase impl → test:**\n- No additional gates\n\n**RFC phase test → stable:**\n- No additional gates (assumes tests are passing externally)\n\nFuture gates MAY be added via RFC amendment, but MUST NOT break existing valid workflows.",
