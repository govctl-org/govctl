  "text": "The following resource types MUST be supported as top-level command namespaces:\n\n**1. `rfc` - Request for Comments**\n\nManages RFC specifications (normative documents defining system behavior).\n\n- ID Format: `RFC-NNNN` (e.g., RFC-0001)\n- Lifecycle: draft → normative → deprecated (per [[RFC-0001:C-RFC-STATUS]])\n- Phase: spec → impl → test → stable (per [[RFC-0001:C-RFC-PHASE]])\n\n**2. `adr` - Architecture Decision Record**\n\nManages ADRs (records of architectural decisions).\n\n- ID Format: `ADR-NNNN` (e.g., ADR-0001)\n- Lifecycle: proposed → accepted → superseded, or proposed → rejected (per [[RFC-0001:C-ADR-STATUS]])\n\n**3. `work` - Work Item**\n\nManages work items (tasks, features, bugs).\n\n- ID Format: `WI-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN` (e.g., WI-2026-01-19-001)\n- Lifecycle: queue → active → done, with cancellation at any stage (per [[RFC-0001:C-WORK-STATUS]])\n\n**4. `clause` - RFC Clause**\n\nManages individual clauses within RFCs.\n\n- ID Format: `RFC-NNNN:C-NAME` (e.g., RFC-0001:C-SUMMARY)\n- Lifecycle: active → deprecated → superseded (per [[RFC-0001:C-CLAUSE-STATUS]])\n\n**Clause Namespace vs Storage:**\n\nClauses remain at the CLI top-level namespace despite being child resources of RFCs because their ID format (RFC-NNNN:C-NAME) is self-scoping and unambiguous.\n\nThe CLI namespace is independent of filesystem layout. Implementations MAY store clause files nested under RFC directories (e.g., `gov/rfc/RFC-0001/clauses/C-NAME.json`) while maintaining the flat CLI command structure (`govctl clause get RFC-0001:C-NAME`).\n\n**5. `release` - Release Version**\n\nManages release versions and changelogs.\n\n- ID Format: Semantic version (e.g., 1.0.0)\n- No lifecycle (immutable once created)\n\n**Resource Identification:**\n\nEach resource type MUST have a unique, predictable ID format that:\n1. Is stable across filesystem operations\n2. Can be referenced in other artifacts\n3. Clearly identifies the resource type without context\n4. Supports lexicographic sorting where meaningful\n5. Is case-sensitive (RFC-0001 ≠ rfc-0001)\n\n**Timestamp Format:**\n\nAll timestamps in resource metadata (created, updated, started, completed) MUST use ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD) in UTC timezone.\n\n**Future Extensions:**\n\nAdditional resource types MAY be added via RFC amendment. New resource types MUST follow the same structural patterns defined in [[RFC-0002:C-CRUD-VERBS]].",
