# ADR-0001: Use TOML for ADRs and Work Items

> **Status:** accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-17

**References:** RFC-0000:C-ADR-DEF, RFC-0000:C-WORK-DEF

## Context

ADRs and Work Items need a human-readable, machine-parseable format.
JSON is verbose and hard to edit manually. YAML has implicit typing issues.
TOML provides explicit typing, clean multiline strings, and good tooling support.

## Decision

Use TOML for ADRs and Work Items instead of JSON.
Structure follows [govctl] metadata section and [content] body section.
This aligns with Rust ecosystem conventions (Cargo.toml).

## Consequences

Positive: Easier manual editing, cleaner diffs, natural multiline support.
Negative: Different format from RFC clauses (which remain JSON for richer structure).
Migration: Existing JSON-based work items would need conversion.
