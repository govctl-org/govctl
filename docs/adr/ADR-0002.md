# ADR-0002: Fix artifact lifecycle design flaws

> **Status:** accepted | **Date:** 2026-01-17

**References:** RFC-0000

## Context

Analysis of the artifact lifecycle state machines revealed several design flaws:

1. **Clause `kind` vs `status` duplication**: The `kind` enum includes `deprecated` alongside `normative` and `informative`, but `status` also has `deprecated`. This creates confusion about where deprecation state belongs.

2. **ADR missing `rejected` state**: The ADR lifecycle is `proposed → accepted → superseded`. If a proposal is rejected rather than accepted, there is no state to record this outcome. The alternative is leaving it as `proposed` forever or deleting it, both of which lose information.

3. **Work Item forced activation before cancellation**: The lifecycle `queue → active → done|cancelled` implies you must start work before abandoning it. This is illogical - planned work can be abandoned before starting.

4. **RFC status×phase constraint rules undocumented**: The 3×4 matrix of valid/invalid status×phase combinations exists implicitly but is not formally documented in SCHEMA.md.

## Decision

We will fix all four lifecycle design flaws:

1. **Remove `deprecated` from Clause `kind`**: The `kind` field should only contain semantic categories (`normative`, `informative`). Deprecation is a lifecycle state that belongs in `status`.

2. **Add `rejected` to ADR lifecycle**: The new lifecycle becomes:
   ```
   proposed → accepted → superseded
            → rejected
   ```
   This allows recording when a proposal was considered but declined.

3. **Allow Work Item `queue → cancelled`**: The new lifecycle becomes:
   ```
   queue → active → done
       ↘        ↘ cancelled
   ```
   Work can be abandoned at any stage.

4. **Document RFC constraint rules**: Add explicit invariant rules to SCHEMA.md stating when status×phase combinations are forbidden.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns (kind = category, status = lifecycle)
- Complete lifecycle coverage for all artifact types
- Explicit rules prevent confusion about valid state combinations

**Negative:**
- Existing tools validating `kind: deprecated` will need updating
- Schema version bump required for breaking changes

**Migration:**
- Any clause with `kind: deprecated` should change to `kind: normative, status: deprecated`
- Currently no such clauses exist in the codebase
