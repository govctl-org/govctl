# RFC-0000: What an RFC Is

> **Version:** 0.1.0 | **Status:** draft | **Phase:** spec

---

## 1. Summary

---

## 2. Specification

---

## 3. Definition

### [RFC-0000:C-RFC-DEF] RFC Definition (Normative)

An RFC is a **normative document** that defines intent, constraints, or decisions which govern implementation within PhaseOS.

An RFC is not a suggestion. It is law.

Every RFC MUST contain a JSON source file (`rfc.json`) with:
- `rfc_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `RFC-0001`)
- `title`: Human-readable title
- `version`: Semantic version
- `status`: Lifecycle state (`draft`, `normative`, `deprecated`)
- `phase`: Work stage (`spec`, `impl`, `test`, `stable`)
- `owners`: List of responsible parties
- `sections`: Ordered list of sections with clause references

*Since: v0.1.0*

## 4. Lifecycle

### [RFC-0000:C-STATUS-LIFECYCLE] Status Lifecycle (Normative)

RFC status follows this lifecycle:

```
draft → normative → deprecated
```

- **draft**: Under discussion. No implementation may depend on it.
- **normative**: Frozen. Implementation MUST conform to it.
- **deprecated**: Superseded. Implementation SHOULD migrate away.

State transitions:
- `draft → normative`: Requires explicit approval and phase gate passage
- `normative → deprecated`: Requires a superseding RFC in normative status

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0000:C-PHASE-LIFECYCLE] Phase Lifecycle (Normative)

RFC phase follows this lifecycle:

```
spec → impl → test → stable
```

- **spec**: Defining what will be built
- **impl**: Building what was specified
- **test**: Verifying implementation
- **stable**: Released for use

Phases MUST NOT be skipped. Each phase transition requires the previous phase gate to pass.

Phase constraints:
- `draft + stable` is FORBIDDEN (cannot stabilize unratified work)
- `deprecated + impl/test` is FORBIDDEN (no new work on deprecated specs)

*Since: v0.1.0*
