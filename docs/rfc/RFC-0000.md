# RFC-0000: govctl Governance Framework

> **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Status:** normative | **Phase:** stable

---

## 1. Summary

### [RFC-0000:C-SUMMARY] Framework Summary (Informative) <a id="rfc-0000c-summary"></a>

govctl is a governance CLI that manages four artifact types:

- **RFCs**: Normative specifications that define intent and constraints
- **Clauses**: Individual requirements within RFCs
- **ADRs**: Architectural Decision Records documenting design choices
- **Work Items**: Units of work tracking implementation progress

All artifacts follow explicit lifecycle states and phase gates to ensure disciplined development.

*Since: v1.0.0*

## 2. RFC Specification

### [RFC-0000:C-RFC-DEF] RFC Definition (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-rfc-def"></a>

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a normative document that defines intent, constraints, or decisions governing implementation.

An RFC is not a suggestion. It is law.

Every RFC MUST be stored as a JSON file (`rfc.json`) containing:
- `rfc_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., RFC-0001)
- `title`: Human-readable title
- `version`: Semantic version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- `status`: Lifecycle state (draft | normative | deprecated)
- `phase`: Work stage (spec | impl | test | stable)
- `owners`: List of responsible parties
- `sections`: Ordered list of sections with clause references
- `changelog`: Version history

*Since: v1.0.0*

### [RFC-0000:C-STATUS-LIFECYCLE] RFC Status Lifecycle (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-status-lifecycle"></a>

RFC status follows this lifecycle:

    draft → normative → deprecated

**draft**: Under discussion. Implementation MUST NOT depend on draft RFCs.

**normative**: Frozen and ratified. Implementation MUST conform to normative RFCs.

**deprecated**: Superseded or obsolete. Implementation SHOULD migrate away.

Transition rules:
- draft → normative: Requires explicit finalization
- normative → deprecated: Requires a superseding RFC or explicit deprecation
- Reverse transitions are FORBIDDEN

*Since: v1.0.0*

### [RFC-0000:C-PHASE-LIFECYCLE] RFC Phase Lifecycle (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-phase-lifecycle"></a>

RFC phase follows this lifecycle:

    spec → impl → test → stable

**spec**: Defining what will be built. No implementation work permitted.

**impl**: Building what was specified. Implementation proceeds per spec.

**test**: Verifying implementation matches specification.

**stable**: Released for production use.

Phase rules:
- Phases MUST proceed in order; skipping is FORBIDDEN
- Each phase transition requires the previous phase gate to pass
- draft + stable is FORBIDDEN (cannot stabilize unratified work)
- deprecated + impl/test is FORBIDDEN (no new work on deprecated specs)

*Since: v1.0.0*

---

## 3. Clause Specification

### [RFC-0000:C-CLAUSE-DEF] Clause Definition (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-clause-def"></a>

A clause is an individual requirement or statement within an RFC.

Every clause MUST be stored as a JSON file containing:
- `clause_id`: Unique identifier within the RFC (e.g., C-PHASE-ORDER)
- `title`: Human-readable title
- `kind`: normative | informative
- `status`: active | superseded | deprecated
- `text`: The clause content
- `since`: Version when the clause was introduced

Clause kinds:
- **normative**: Defines a requirement. Implementations MUST comply.
- **informative**: Provides context. No compliance requirement.

Deprecation is a lifecycle state (in `status`), not a document kind.

*Since: v1.0.0*

---

## 4. ADR Specification

### [RFC-0000:C-ADR-DEF] ADR Definition (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-adr-def"></a>

An ADR (Architectural Decision Record) documents a significant design decision.

Every ADR MUST be stored as a TOML file containing:
- `[govctl]` section with: id, title, status, date, refs
- `[content]` section with: context, decision, consequences

ADR status lifecycle:

    proposed → accepted → superseded
             → rejected

**proposed**: Under consideration. Not yet binding.

**accepted**: Ratified. Design SHOULD follow this decision.

**rejected**: Declined after consideration. Reason documented in decision field.

**superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR. Listed in `superseded_by` field.

*Since: v1.0.0*

---

## 5. Work Item Specification

### [RFC-0000:C-WORK-DEF] Work Item Definition (Normative) <a id="rfc-0000c-work-def"></a>

A Work Item tracks a unit of work from inception to completion.

Every Work Item MUST be stored as a TOML file containing:
- `[govctl]` section with: id, title, status, refs
- `[content]` section with: description, acceptance_criteria, decisions, notes

Work Item status lifecycle:

    queue → active → done
        ↘        ↘ cancelled

**queue**: Planned but not started.

**active**: Currently in progress. Only one active item recommended per focus area.

**done**: Completed. All acceptance criteria met.

**cancelled**: Abandoned from queue or active. Reason documented in notes.

A Work Item MUST NOT transition to done if any acceptance_criteria are pending.

*Since: v1.0.0*
