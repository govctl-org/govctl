# RFC-0001: Lifecycle State Machines

> **Version:** 0.2.0 | **Status:** normative | **Phase:** stable

---

## 1. Summary

### [RFC-0001:C-SUMMARY] Summary (Informative) <a id="rfc-0001c-summary"></a>

This RFC defines state machines governing RFC, ADR, Work Item, and Clause lifecycles.

*Since: v0.1.0*

---

## 2. Specification

### [RFC-0001:C-RFC-STATUS] RFC Status Transitions (Normative) <a id="rfc-0001c-rfc-status"></a>

An RFC MUST have exactly one of the following status values:

1. **draft** — Initial state. The RFC is under development and not yet binding.
2. **normative** — The RFC defines required behavior. Implementations MUST conform. Per [[ADR-0016]], normative RFCs MAY be amended via version bumping.
3. **deprecated** — The RFC is no longer recommended. Existing conforming implementations MAY continue, but new implementations SHOULD NOT use this RFC.

Valid transitions:
- draft → normative (via `finalize` command)
- normative → deprecated (via `deprecate` command)

Invalid transitions (MUST be rejected):
- normative → draft (no "un-finalize")
- deprecated → normative (no resurrection)
- deprecated → draft (no resurrection)
- Any skip (e.g., draft → deprecated directly)

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0001:C-RFC-PHASE] RFC Phase Transitions (Normative) <a id="rfc-0001c-rfc-phase"></a>

An RFC MUST have exactly one of the following phase values:

1. **spec** — Specification phase. The RFC text is being written. No implementation work.
2. **impl** — Implementation phase. Code is being written to conform to the RFC.
3. **test** — Testing phase. Implementation is complete; tests are being written and validated.
4. **stable** — Stable phase. Implementation and tests are complete. No further changes expected.

Valid transitions (forward only, via `advance` command):
- spec → impl
- impl → test
- test → stable

Invalid transitions (MUST be rejected):
- Any backward transition (e.g., impl → spec)
- Any skip (e.g., spec → test, spec → stable)
- stable → any (stable is terminal for phase)

Rationale: Phase discipline ensures specification precedes implementation, and testing validates implementation before stabilization.

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0001:C-WORK-STATUS] Work Item Status Transitions (Normative) <a id="rfc-0001c-work-status"></a>

A Work Item MUST have exactly one of the following status values:

1. **queue** — Initial state. The work item is defined but not yet started.
2. **active** — The work item is currently being worked on.
3. **done** — The work item is complete. All acceptance criteria are satisfied.
4. **cancelled** — The work item was abandoned. No further work will be done.

Valid transitions (via `move` command):
- queue → active (start work)
- queue → cancelled (abandon before starting)
- active → done (complete work)
- active → cancelled (abandon in progress)

Invalid transitions (MUST be rejected):
- done → any (done is terminal)
- cancelled → any (cancelled is terminal)
- queue → done (cannot complete without being active)
- active → queue (no "un-start")

Timestamp behavior:
- queue → active: Sets `started` date if not already set
- active → done: Sets `completed` date
- active → cancelled: Sets `completed` date

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0001:C-ADR-STATUS] ADR Status Transitions (Normative) <a id="rfc-0001c-adr-status"></a>

An ADR MUST have exactly one of the following status values:

1. **proposed** — Initial state. The decision is under consideration.
2. **accepted** — The decision has been accepted and is in effect.
3. **superseded** — The decision has been replaced by another ADR.

Valid transitions:
- proposed → accepted (via `accept` command)
- accepted → superseded (via `supersede` command, requires `--by` to specify replacement)

Invalid transitions (MUST be rejected):
- proposed → superseded (cannot supersede without first accepting)
- accepted → proposed (no "un-accept")
- superseded → any (superseded is terminal)

When an ADR is superseded:
- The `superseded_by` field MUST be set to the ID of the replacing ADR
- The replacing ADR SHOULD reference the superseded ADR

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0001:C-CLAUSE-STATUS] Clause Status Transitions (Normative) <a id="rfc-0001c-clause-status"></a>

A Clause MUST have exactly one of the following status values:

1. **active** — Default state. The clause is in effect.
2. **deprecated** — The clause is no longer recommended but still valid.
3. **superseded** — The clause has been replaced by another clause.

Valid transitions:
- active → deprecated (via `deprecate` command)
- active → superseded (via `supersede` command, requires replacement clause)
- deprecated → superseded (already deprecated, now replaced)

Invalid transitions (MUST be rejected):
- deprecated → active (no resurrection)
- superseded → any (superseded is terminal)

When a clause is superseded:
- The `superseded_by` field MUST be set to the ID of the replacing clause
- The replacing clause SHOULD have a `since` field indicating the version it was introduced

*Since: v0.1.0*

### [RFC-0001:C-GATE-CONDITIONS] Transition Gate Conditions (Normative) <a id="rfc-0001c-gate-conditions"></a>

Certain transitions have additional gate conditions beyond the state machine rules.

**Work Item → done:**
1. The work item MUST have at least one acceptance criterion defined
2. All acceptance criteria MUST have status "done" or "cancelled" (no "pending")

Rationale: Prevents marking work as complete without defined success criteria.

**RFC draft → normative:**
- No additional gates (policy decision, not structural)

**RFC phase spec → impl:**
- RFC status SHOULD be normative (warning if draft)

Rationale: Implementation should follow finalized specification.

**RFC phase impl → test:**
- No additional gates

**RFC phase test → stable:**
- No additional gates (assumes tests are passing externally)

Future gates MAY be added via RFC amendment, but MUST NOT break existing valid workflows.

*Since: v0.1.0*
